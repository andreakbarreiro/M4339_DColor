# M4339_DColor
Domain coloring tools for Math 4339 at SMU

## What is DColor?

This is a Python3 module for visualizing complex-valued functions using a [Domain Coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring) scheme. 

This version is adapted from DColor by Anthony Hernandez https://github.com/hernanat/dcolor 

The main change is to include coloring schemes from PPGUI, a Matlab package by Elias Wegert (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44375-phase-plots-of-complex-functions). If you prefer to use Matlab, I recommend it.

## Requirements

DColor uses two well-known Python libraries: Numpy and Matplotlib. 
You can install these using pip: 

`$ python3 -m pip install -U numpy`

`$ python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib`
